Title: Estimate Hemiplasy and Homoplasy on a Phylogeny
Version: 0.2
Author: Rafael Guerrero
Maintainer: Rafael Guerrero <rafguerr@indiana.edu>
Description: P(e):P(o) implements methods to calculate the probabilities of hemiplasy 
    (trait evolution incongruent with species tree due to incomplete
    lineage sorting) and homoplasy (incongruent traits due to convergent mutations). In this version, the
    package includes functions to estimate and plot the relative fraction of incongruency due to 
    hemiplasy--the Hemiplasy Risk Factor (HRF)-- of all branches on a phylogeny, provided a tree is in coalescent units.
